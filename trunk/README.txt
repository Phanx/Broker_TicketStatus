Feedback
-----------

**Post a comment on WoWInterface.** If you are reporting a bug, please
include detailed instructions I can follow to reproduce the bug myself,
whether or not it still happens when all other addons are disabled, and
the exact text of the first related error message (if any) from BugSack.

If you need to contact me privately, you can send a private message to
Phanx on either download site, or email me at <addons@phanx.net>.
**Please note** that I do not provide private addon support or tutoring
of any kind; post a comment or forum thread instead!
